# YAPL-Project-using-python-PLY
I made the basics of my own coding language using python's library PLY as part of my Automata course project.  
It implements python's PLY library from where we use ply.lex for tokenizing and ply.yacc for parsing.

==== FUNCTIONS ====  
Declare variables: int, string, bool, char, double. Example: int a = 40;  
Declare lists: list a = [1,2,3];  
Do while loops: DO {print("Hello");} WHILE( 2==2);  
Print statements  
Arithmetic operations  (+ , - , / , * , ^, % , ++, --)  
Logical operations (<, >, <=,>=, !=, ==, NOT, AND, OR)  
Nested parentheses  
Nested loops  

==== HOW TO RUN ====  
Run interpreter.py on the terminal with the text file name as an argument  
EXAMPLE: python interpreter.py lists.txt
This will run a test case for list.
  
If you want to add another text file please put it in test_cases folder.
